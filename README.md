### Hi, I'm Jadi! 👋
I'm currently working on...
- the prototype that may eventually become my Computer Science Capstone project at Ball State University.
- a fishing game made in Godot Engine with a group of friends.
- updating my [website](https://jadi.codes/) to accurately represent myself and my work.
